                    My name is Almidzfar B. Castor, I live in Brgy. Mabuhay, Molave ZDS <br>
                    I'm 18 years old and I'm currently a 1st year college student in Blancia College Foundation Inc. (BCFI) <br>
                    I took the course in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) <br><br>

                <b>Family</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                   My family is a diverse and tightly-knit group, spanning multiple generations and cultural <br>
                   backgrounds. From our ancestors who emigrated to seek a better life, to the love that has <br>
                   always been the bedrock of our unity, our shared traditions and values have held us together. <br>
                   Despite facing numerous challenges, we have overcome them with unwavering resilience <br>
                   and celebrated our triumphs together. As we look ahead, our family is evolving and growing, <br>
                   and we are dedicated to preserving our legacy of love, unity, and cherished traditions for <br>
                   generations to come. <br><br>

                <b>Friends</b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Friendship is a precious gem that adorns the mosaic of my life, each friend a unique facet. <br>
                    Childhood friends are the bedrock, understanding me in a way no one else can; college <br>
                    buddies, a kaleidoscope of shared adventures, laughter, and dreams; work pals, reliable <br>
                    companions through the daily grind, offering camaraderie and support; and new friends, <br>
                    exciting additions with whom I'm building fresh connections. These friendships, old and new, <br>
                    are like a constellation in the night sky, each star representing a different but equally <br>
                    cherished friend, collectively illuminating the path of my life with joy, love, and countless <br>
                    unforgettable moments. <br><br>
